# Here's a look at 2025...

This year was full of unforgettable memories! We planned our wedding and tied the knot on May 10th, moved into our College Station apartment, and have loved our first months of marraige. Emma is finishing her last year of Physical Therapy school, and Logan is wrapping up the Fellows Program, and you can read all about it right here:

## Spring
In the Spring, we were knee deep in wedding planning. Emma was finishing her second year of Physical Therapy school at Texas State University (Round Rock), and Logan was finishing his first year in the Fellows Program residency at Grace Bible Church (College Station). Long distance was tough, but we worked hard during the day and prepared for the wedding at night, taking every opportunity to travel the distance and see each other. 

Emma has loved PT school! Between classes, labs, and studying, she continued to grow in her skills and passion for helping others. It was a challenging year, but also one full of progress and accomplishments. Meanwhile, Logan completed his first year as a College Fellow at Grace Bible Church. From mentoring students to leading Bible studies, it was a year of growth, learning, and deepening relationships with college students.

## Summer
We celebrated our wedding on May 10th! Check out our photos from our big day and our honeymoon down below. 

After the wedding, we moved in to our apartment in College Station and Emma started her 3rd year. She'll do four residencies at clinics around College Station, learning and practicing therapudic skills and discovering what type of PT she wants to pursue in the future. She will finish and graduate in May 2026, and then work as a DPT. 

We also spent time during the summer going on lake trips with our family, exploring crawfish broils in small Texas towns, and cooking great foods!

## Fall
In August, Logan's semester came in full force with college students returning to Texas A&M. The college ministry at Grace Bible Church is full of amazing students, and part of Logan's job is coaching leaders in the college ministry to help other students find and follow Jesus.

Also, Logan has been working on his Masters of Theology at Dallas Theological Seminary and he's loving it! He's taking classes in Biblical studies and leadership, and he’s excited to apply what he’s learning to job and daily life.
