This year was unforgettable! We planned a rocking wedding, tied the knot on May 10th, moved into our apartment in College Station, and have loved our first months of marriage. Emma is finishing her last year of Physical Therapy school, and Logan is wrapping up the Fellows Program, and you can read all about it right here:

## Spring

All throughout the Spring, we were knee deep in wedding planning. Emma was finishing her second year of *Physical Therapy school at Texas State University (Round Rock)*, and Logan was wrapping up his first year in the *Fellows Program residency at Grace Bible Church (College Station)*. Long distance was tough, but we worked hard during the day and prepared for the wedding at night, taking every opportunity to travel the distance and see each other on the weekends. Our constant prayer throughout the Spring was that God would prepare us for the beginning of our marriage and that He would surround us with Christ-like friends, and He is doing it!

I (Emma) have loved PT school! From classes, labs, and studying, I've been growing in all my skills and in my passion for helping people. It was a challenging year, but also one full of progress and growth. Meanwhile, I (Logan) completed my first year as a College Fellow at Grace Bible Church. I've been spending my days mentoring college students, leading Bible studies, and helping people find and follow Jesus. Both of us have been learning, growing, and deepening our relationships in our work and in our community, especially with friends at our church. One verse that we've been understanding more and more is Hebrews 10:24, that says, "*Let us consider how to stir up one another towards love and good works,*" and God has been showing us how to do that in our marriage and in our friendships! 

The spring was busy, but we still managed to have some fun. We went to Emma's PT Prom, had a beautiful wedding shower, and got everything prepped for the big day!

### Lisbon, Portugal
We honeymooned in Lisbon, Portugal, and just took the chance to roam around the beautiful city. It was *INCREDIBLE*.

After the wedding, we moved in to our apartment in College Station and Emma started her 3rd year of PT school. She'll do four residencies at clinics around College Station, learning and practicing therapeutic skills and discovering what type of PT she wants to pursue in the future. She'll finish residencies and graduate in May 2026, and then work as a DPT! 

We also spent time during the summer going on lake trips with our family, exploring crawfish broils in small Texas towns, and cooking great foods!

## Fall
In August, Logan's semester came in full force with college students coming back to Texas A&M. The college ministry at Grace Bible Church is full of amazing students, and part of my job is coaching leaders in our ministry to help other students find and follow Jesus. 

I've also been working on my Masters of Theology at Dallas Theological Seminary and I'm loving it! I'm taking classes in Biblical studies and leadership, and I'm constantly getting to apply what I learn to job and daily life.

## Looking Ahead
2026 is shaping up to be a big year for us! Emma will graduate in May and take her licensure exam over the summer, right around the same time Logan finishes the Fellows Program at Grace. We’re spending this season praying about what God has next for us and trusting Him to guide our steps. Along the way, we’ll be looking for a physical therapy clinic for Emma, and Logan will continue working on his Masters. We’re excited to see how God will use all these changes to grow us, both personally and in our callings, and we can’t wait to dive into the adventures ahead!
